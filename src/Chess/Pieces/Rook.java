 * The Rook is a piece that can move in columns and rows indefinitely until it hits its own piece, captures, or hits the edge of the board.
 * The Rook can perform a special move with the King, if neither has been moved yet in the game, there are no pieces
 * directly between them, and no tiles are "threatened" by the opponent, then the King can move two spaces towards the Rook,
 * and the Rook will move to the opposite side of the King in a move called castling.  The algebraic notation is O-O for
 * a King side castle and O-O-O for a Queen side castle.
