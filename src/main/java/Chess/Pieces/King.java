/**
 * The King is a piece that can move one space to any of the eight adjacent tiles, it can also capture on any of the eight.
 * The King can perform a special move with the Rook, if neither has been moved yet in the game, there are no pieces
 * directly between them, and no tiles are "threatened" by the opponentOf, then the King can move two spaces towards the Rook,
 * and the Rook will move to the opposite side of the King in a move called castling.  The algebraic notation is O-O for
 * a King side castle and O-O-O for a Queen side castle.
